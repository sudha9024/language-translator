# language-translator
This project is a serverless language translation backend built using AWS services. The backend allows you to upload documents to an S3 bucket, translates their content into a target language using Amazon Translate, and stores the translated output in another S3 bucket. The entire process is triggered by S3 events and is processed using AWS Lambda.
